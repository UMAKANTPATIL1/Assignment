# Project: Web & Java Development Tasks

## Overview
This project consists of five different tasks covering web design, Java programming, and JavaScript DOM manipulation.

## Task 1: Simple Profile Card
**Description:**
A responsive profile card designed using HTML and CSS. The card includes:
- A profile picture
- Name and designation
- A short bio
- Social media icons
- CSS animations for hover effects

**Features:**
- The card is centered on the page.
- Fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- Includes smooth hover animations.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox, Media Queries, Transitions)

## Task 2: String Manipulation - Anagram Check
**Description:**
A Java program that takes two strings as input and checks if they are anagrams (contain the same characters in a different order).

**Example:**
```
Input: "listen", "silent"
Output: true

Input: "hello", "world"
Output: false
```

**Technologies Used:**
- Java (String Manipulation, Arrays, Loops)

## Task 3: Object-Oriented Programming - Employee Management System
**Description:**
A simple Employee Management System in Java that includes:
- An `Employee` class with attributes: `id`, `name`, and `salary`.
- A method `displayDetails()` to print employee details.
- A `main` method that:
  - Creates at least three Employee objects.
  - Stores them in a list.
  - Displays their details.

**Technologies Used:**
- Java (OOP concepts, Lists, Methods)

## Task 4: To-Do List using JavaScript
**Description:**
A simple to-do list implemented using JavaScript and the DOM.

**Features:**
- Allows users to add new tasks.
- Displays tasks in a list format.
- Provides a button to remove each task.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Event Handling)

## Task 5: DOM Manipulation - Image Slider
**Description:**
An image slider implemented using JavaScript that:
- Displays one image at a time.
- Has `Next` and `Previous` buttons for navigation.
- Uses an array of image URLs.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Arrays, Event Listeners, DOM Manipulation)

## Setup and Usage
### **Web Development Tasks (Profile Card, To-Do List, Image Slider)**
1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
2. Ensure that the CSS and JavaScript files are linked correctly.
3. Interact with the profile card, to-do list, and image slider.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates skills in HTML, CSS, Java, and JavaScript. Each task is independently functional and showcases different programming concepts.
